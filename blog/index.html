        <h1>Steak in Lagos: Fusion Steakhouse & Sushi</h1>
        <p>I knew I was going to dine out at the lagoon restaurant that evening, what I didn't know was the surprise I was in for. The lagoon restaurant is a big restaurant that brings together five different cuisines Chinese, Continental, Indian, Brazilian(Churrasco), and Japanese (Fusion Steak house & Sushi).</p>

        <p>When my Uber arrived at the location, the first familiar place I noticed was Zorya, then I wondered why I haven't been to the Lagoon restaurant other than being familiar with the name. </p>

        <p>The foyer of Fusion Steakhouse & sushi was quite prominent, you can't miss it when you enter the compound. As I approached the door a staff opened, I was welcomed by the soft soothing music, warm lighten, and the interior. I wasn't expecting the interior my eyes were blessed with, it was just beautiful. It is a well-thought-out minimalist design, that perfectly describes the restaurant. I can try to explain but it won't do justice, just go visit I am confident that you will love it.        </p>

        <p>We ordered the steak, prawns, and Fried rice. The chef came in with his mobile cooking tools, seeing this my phone was ready to record the show, lol, preparation took between 5 - 10 mins. All the food items were layed on the table. I took a few seconds to enjoy the view before I feasted</p>

        <p>The steak was delicious, the kind your tongue can get addicted to,  it hit every note.
