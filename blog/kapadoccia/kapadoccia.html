        <h1>Dining in the cave: Kapadoccia Lagos</h1>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-frontview-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>When I think of vacation, Cappadocia comes on my top five places to visit, I know I'm not the only one that has dreamt of vacationing in the magical city with stone cone-shaped rocks (fairy chimney), waterfalls, and hot-air balloons. Imagine my awe, when I found a new spot that gives you the Cappadocia fairy chimney vibe, a charming waterfall, lanterns that mimicks hot-air balloons, topped with some Turkish meals in Lagos - If you know me you would know my love for foreign cuisines and good scenes. </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-doorview-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p> <span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kapadoccia_lagos/?hl=en" class="italic">Kapadoccia</a></span> Lagos is strictly by reservation. You can't just work in with the hope of getting a table, except you're Mc Oluomo. It took forever to book a reservation, but I successfully got a reservation for 8: 00 pm, even though they were fully booked till the 31st of December.
        </p>

        <p>I got to the restaurant 30 minutes late. The foyer of the place is nothing you've seen - it was all covered in cave-like materials; With windows that looked like eyes under it has the crest of the waterfall, then a wooden barrel door centered on a plunge pool. But this mesmerizing view was interrupted by the stench coming from the waste bin situated at the front corner of the building. They should really do something about that!.
        </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-insideview-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>They were two doormen outside the building. As I got inside the restaurant, I was greeted by the host, who confirmed my reservation, and I was taken to my table by a waitress by the name of Titi (I'm mentioning her name because she was really nice). </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-insideview2-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>I scanned the menu barcode on the table to revile the menu - I ordered for Hummus (been wanting to try it), Chicken Tagliatelle, Chargrilled Lamb Chops (medium rear), and Four cousins red wine to go with the dish. </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-reserved-chiar-view-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>The Hummus came in fast, it was a Creamy paste decorated with sliced cucumber and pita bread. I was so eager to try it, I took a big scope of the hummus with a piece of the sliced cucumber - it had a creamy, slightly nutty taste with high notes of tangy-acidic flavor. It tasted better with the pita bread, though it was ok, I don't think I will try it a second time. </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadocci-menu-hummus-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p> While having my starter, the pasta came in, before I go on to talk about my pasta, let's talk about the table setting, the utensils, the plates were all set nicely. The spoon, fork, and knife scream of luxury. </p>
        <img src="../../images/kapadoccia-menu-tagliattelle-pasta-by-juliet ikiba.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p>Back to my food, it smelled so good. I have never had that much chicken in my pasta before, so generous. With every scope, I get a good amount of chicken. The mashed tomato sauce was ok, not overly tasty nor spicy, just perfect. The pasta was delicious. </p>

        <p>I turned to my Chargrilled Lamb Chops after I had devoured half of my pasta. This is a roasted lamb chop served with a cream sauce and veggies.  <br> <br> Nothing excites me in eating meat than seeing the fatty bits. This lamb had a fatty side, a meaty side, and a little handle of bone which made it perfect for picking up and eating with my fingers.  <br> <br>The lamb was medium cooked, which made it tasty and juicy on the inside. You can see how tender the meat is here!</p>

        <p>In conclusion, I enjoyed the dishes I had in <span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kapadoccia_lagos/?hl=en" class="italic">Kapadoccia</a></span>, the pasta was the highlight for me. Another thing that stood out was the waitress (Titi), that was constantly making sure my wine glass wasn't empty and that I was enjoying myself - the last three restaurants I visited were too understaffed/nonchalant to care if my wine glass was empty or if I was satisfied with my meal. <br> <br> After paying my bill, I was given a note where I was asked to write a review, You already know what I did. I will definitely visit this restaurant again. <br> <br>
